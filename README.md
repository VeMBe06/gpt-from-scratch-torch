# GPT From Scratch

This is a coding exercise taken from [Andrej Karpathy's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY), where the
goal was to build a GTP-2 like deep learning model from scratch using Pytorch. I want to train it on some
French text corpus to see how it works and maybe show it to others.
